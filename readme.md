gcp is very simple _git clone_ helper, which does exactly one task:
launches cloning of some git repo into "git_user_name"+ "_" + "repo_name" folder

Just in case if it is more convenient for you to have a name of a user you cloned the repo from in the folder name.

To use it one needs python installed in the system, and correct script to launch _python gcp.py_ with the folder name in
path -- the example provided as gcp.bat

Then it is as simpe as to type _gcp_ , paste the repo link and hit Enter

The name came from Git Clone (with) Python

Tested with Win10 and python 3.10 .
